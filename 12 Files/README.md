For this project, there will be 2 programs to write.  Write a program that writes a series of random numbers to a file.  
Each random number should be in the range of 1 to 500.  If you need help with generating random numbers check out: 
https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-generate-a-random-number-in-python/
The application should let the user specify how many random numbers the file will hold.  
Then, write another program that reads the random numbers from a file, display the numbers, and then display the following data:

- The total of the numbers
- The number of random numbers read from the file.
