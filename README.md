## Projects

## 2 Variables and Expressions
>Sept-8 Assignment operators and arithmetic operations in Python. Here we go again!

## 3 Types
>Sept-11 Basic arithmetic, I like how python can read input though. Super quick.

## 4 Branching
>Sept-16 Loops again. I'm not a fan of the word 'elif'. It's like they just wanted to change it to change it. Is it that hard to type else if?
## 5 Loops
>Sept-23 Brother, more loops. The for loop is set up weird, I don't know if someone can look at that and understand that they're starting at 0 and going to the
>number they specify, but it's also a little easier to write a lower<i<upper range in Python.
