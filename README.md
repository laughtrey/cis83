## Projects

## 2 Variables and Expressions
>Sept-8 Assignment operators and arithmetic operations in Python. Here we go again!

## 3 Types
>Sept-11 Basic arithmetic, I like how python can read input though. Super quick.

## 4 Branching
>Sept-16 Loops again. I'm not a fan of the word 'elif'. It's like they just wanted to change it to change it. Is it that hard to type else if?

## 5 Loops
>Sept-23 Brother, more loops. The for loop is set up weird, I don't know if someone can look at that and understand that they're starting at 0 and going to the
>number they specify, but it's also a little easier to write a ``lower <i < upper`` range in Python.

## 6 Functions
>Sept-30 Functions in Python freak me out a little bit. They're just floating there, hoping you remembered to hit tab. I miss my {  }.

## 7 Strings
>Oct-7 Simple string functions, but they're sort of tricking us into working with lists and capitalizations and such. I used a lambda for the .capitalize() function
>and it did the job just fine.
