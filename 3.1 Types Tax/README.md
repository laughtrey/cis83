### Types
>Write a program that will ask the user to enter the amount of a purchase. 
>The program should then compute the state and county sales tax. 
>Assume the state sales tax is 5 percent and the county sales tax is 2.5 percent. 
>The program should display the amount of the purchase, the state sales tax, the county sales tax, the total sales tax, 
>and the total of the sale (which is the sum of the amount of purchase plus the total sales tax). 

Hint: To calculate the tax, multiply by the tax percentage. So, if the purchase amount is 25.00 and the state sales tax is 7.5% the tax is calculated as: 25.0 * 0.075 so the sales tax is: 1.875 and the total price with the sales tax would be: 25.0 + 1.875 = 26.875
