### Functions
>Write functions that will calculate and return the following:

- `sphere_volume(radius)`

    Where r is the radius and d is the diameter, it would be better to choose r for the variable.


- `sphere_surface(radius)`
![spheresurface](https://i.imgur.com/hhPGuO5.png)

where r = radius of sphere

- `cylinder_volume(radius,height)`

![cylindervolume](https://i.imgur.com/fpwDJ7S.png)

where r = radius of sphere and h = height

- `cylinder_surface(radius,height)`

- `cone_volume(radius,height)`

![conevolume](https://i.imgur.com/Js4EkiM.png)

Where r = radius of base of cone , h = height of the cone (perpendicular to base)


- `cone_surface(radius,height)`
