# Dice rolling simulation module
Write a program that uses the random module to simulate rolling dice.  
To obtain a random number between 1 and 6 use the following relationship:

roll = rand_number % 6 + 1

keep track of the number of rolls per each die in a list called rolls (declare it as rolls = [0,0,0,0,0,0]) and "roll" the die 10000 times.  
When done, print out the statistics like this:

1 -  1685

2 -  1662

3 -   1669

4 -  1657

5 - 1651

6 - 1676



create a dice module and put this code in module directory.
